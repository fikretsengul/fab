## :memo: The Motivation

There are several reasons why this boilerplate exists, these are in short to create `clear`, `readable`, `reusable`, `scalable`, `testable`, `performant` and `maintainable` projects but in long:

1.  to allow people to deploy `production-grade MVP products`,
2.  to make sure that I `keep everything stupid simple` (_controversial but I tried my best_),
3.  to ensure that project can `easily scale horizontally` as application grows,
4.  to `save developers time` by `reducing boilerplate code` by writing less and generating more,
5.  to `maintain code quality and platform standards` in team projects with strictly linting rules,
6.  to have `bloc and golden tests` to verify everything working as intended to be,
7.  to ship the application quickly and efficiently by using `CI & CD` to automate the development process.

## :fire: Key Features

- `API System & Authentication`<br>
  Rest and graphql api support with token renewal and socket support using Dio, GraphQL, and Fresh.
- `Performance`<br>
  Performance optimized for lag caused by builds, such as page switches or rapid scrolling of complex lists, through frame-splitting rendering via keframe.
- `State Management & Architecture`<br>
  BLoC & Hydrated Bloc helps to separate Business Logic from UI by creating persistent and powerful state management.
- `Advanced Linting`<br>
  Linting rules with detailed settings to keep the health of the code good and up to the dart standards.
- `Type Safety`<br>
  The boilerplate uses type-safety first approach (languages, assets, etc.) to help you avoid problems by catching null errors during development rather than at runtime.
- `Forms`<br>
  Creating and managing forms has never been so easy and fun. Reactive forms is a model-driven approach to handling forms inputs and validations.
- `Testing`<br>
  The more features the app has, the harder it is to test manually. Automated tests help ensure that the app performs correctly before you publish it with Bloc Test, Golden Tookit, and Mocktail.
- `Dependency Injection & Service Locator`<br>
  Reduce tight coupling between classes thus achieving greater reusability of your code with Injectable and GetIt.
- `Code Generation`<br>
  Maximize productivity and improve code quality by generating data classes with Freezed, Artemis, and Build Runner.
- `CI & CD Integration`<br>
  CI/CD is used to continuously deliver code into production, and ensure an ongoing flow of new features and bug fixes via the most efficient delivery method by using Codemagic.
- `Easy & Clean Routing`<br>
  AutoRouter allows for strongly-typed arguments passing, effortless deep-linking, and code generation to simplify routes reduce code boilerplate.
- `Desing Pattern`<br>
  Repository design pattern reduces the complexity of the data layer, isolates unstructured data from the rest of the app, and organizes project structure.
- `Exception Handling`<br>
  It is not a very ideal solution to handle exceptions using try and catch at every function, Data Channel provides utility for handling exceptions and data routing.
- `Encrypted Storage`<br>
  Encrypted storage allows you to keep token and user informations in platforms keychain securely using Secure Storage.
- `Dynamic Theme`<br>
  With Android 12 and Material You, wallpaper colors can be extracted to create a ColorScheme that can be used to color the app.
- `Localization`<br>
  Easily localize the app into other languages with the support of type-safe structured 'slang' language generator.
- `Permission`<br>
  The boilerplate also provides a cross-platform (iOS, Android) API to request permissions and check their status with permission_handler.
- `Env Variables`<br>
  Environmental variables allows to define global constants shared in the app, for things like API keys, base URLs, and such.
- `Logging & Tracking`<br>
  A detailed logging and error tracking mechanism to monitor every action taking place in the application in real-time with Logging and Sentry.
- `Native Splash`<br>
  Flutter Native Splash automatically generates iOS, Android, and Web-native code for customizing this native splash screen background color and splash image.
- `Refresh Rate`<br>
  Support for high refresh rate displays with the flutter_displaymode package.

# Update goldens & Execute tests
$ fvm flutter test --update-goldens

# Run the app
$ fvm flutter run

# Run the app on web
$ fvm flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer html (low performance, low download size)
$ fvm flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer canvaskit (high performance, high download size)

# If you update your splash screen configuration you can regenerate it via
$ fvm flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
# A Dart Build Plugin that uploads debug symbols for Android, iOS/macOS and source maps for Web to Sentry via sentry-cli.
# The flutter build apk, flutter build ios (or macos) or flutter build web is required before executing the sentry_dart_plugin plugin
$ fvm dart run sentry_dart_plugin
```

### Hide Generated Files

In order to hide generated files, navigate to `'VSCode'` -> `'Preferences'` -> `'Settings'` and search for `'Files: Exclude'` and add the following patterns by pressing the `'Add Pattern'` button:

```
**/*.config.dart
**/*.freezed.dart
**/*.inject.summary
**/*.inject.dart
**/*.g.dart
**/*.gr.dart
```

In Android Studio, navigate to `'Android Studio'` -> `'Preferences'` -> `'Editor'` -> `'File Types'` and paste the below lines under ignore files and folders section:

```
*.config.dart;*.freezed.dart;*.inject.summary;*.inject.dart;*.g.dart;*.gr.dart;
```

## :file_folder: Folder Structure

### Assets Folder

`assets` folder is located above the lib folder. The assets that is used in the application, environmental settings, fonts, images, translations and more are found here.

```
.
└── assets
    ├── animations                          -> put your animated files here eg. lottie
    ├── configs                             -> put your env files here
    │   ├── dev.json                           -> env that is used for dev
    │   ├── prod.json                          -> env that is used for prod
    │   └── test.json                          -> env that is used for tes
    ├── fonts                               -> put your custom font files here
    ├── images                              -> put your image files here
    └── translations                        -> put your translation files here
        ├── en.json
        └── tr.json
```

### Features Folder

The `features` folder, which is the backbone of the application, was designed using the **_feature-first structure_** instead of layer-first because it doesn't scale very well as the app grows and **_repository design pattern_**. The feature-first approach demands that we create a new folder for every new feature that we add to our app. And inside that folder, we can add the repository pattern layers themselves as sub-folders.

```
.
└── lib
    └── features                            -> stands for FEATURE FIRST STRUCTURE
        └── feature_x                          -> seperate and put your features here
            ├── blocs                          -> stands for APPLICATION LAYER
            │   ├── x_cubit.dart                  -> seperate and put your logics here
            │   └── x_state.dart
            ├── models                         -> stands for DOMAIN LAYER
            │   └── x_model.dart                  -> seperate and put your models here
            ├── networking                     -> stands for DATA LAYER
            │   └── x_repository.dart             -> seperate and put your repos here
            └── presentation                   -> stands for PRESENTATION LAYER
                ├── widgets                       -> seperate and put your widgets here
                │   └── x_header_widget.dart
                └── x_screen.dart
```

### Modules Folder

In the `modules` folder, there are dependency injection registration and initialization processes of third-party modules to ensure that they can be easily accessed and used from within the application.

```
.
└── lib
    └── modules
        ├── dependency_injection               -> add your modules injection here
        │   ├── di.dart                           -> must initialize di first
        │   └── x_module_di.dart                  -> example module injection
        └── x_module                           -> create folder for your modules
            └── init_x.dart                       -> create initialization files here
```

### Theme Folder

The `theme` folder contains the necessary theme configuration and settings.

```
.
└── lib
    └── theme
        ├── color
        │   └── app_color_scheme.dart
        ├── text
        │   └── app_typography.dart
        └── app_theme_creator.dart             -> theme creation configuration here
```

### Utils Folder

Apart from the above, constants, helper classes, and methods, shortcuts and many more used throughout the application are located in the `utils` folder.

```
.
└── lib
    └── utils
        ├── helpers                            -> put your helpers here
        │   ├── bar_helper.dart                   -> bar helper to show alert
        │   ├── logging_helper.dart               -> logging helper to show fancy log in console
        │   └── permission_helper.dart            -> permission helper to handle permission requests
        ├── methods                            -> put your methods here
        │   └── aliases.dart                      -> create alias variables here
        │   └── shorcuts.dart                     -> add shortcut methods here
        ├── constants.dart                     -> configure app constants here
        ├── navigation.dart                    -> add navigation destinations here
        ├── r.dart                             -> generated type-safe asset classes here (don't modify)
        └── router.dart                        -> add new screens here
```

## :question: FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Riverpod is quite popular these days for state management. I am curious to hear your thoughts on bloc and why do you prefer it over the others?</summary><br>
  For me, BLoC scales better and is better for larger teams. Riverpod is more like a dependency injection system that also happens to have some state management included. You can totally use blocs or cubits instead of StateNotifier. Others may be;

- If your single screen is so complicated and has so many states then bloc makes code so clean and handles every state easily (especially with the combination of freezed).
- Bloc kinda forces you to separate UI and logic.
- Bloc provides a way to encapsulate your functions with events. That allows you to use event transformers which are so cool. You could make a function concurrent, parallel, debounce, etc. All the while monitoring exactly what each event does and how the state is changed with the help of bloc observers.
- Hydrated bloc is also another cool feature. Just extend hydrated bloc instead of bloc and now you can persist your app state between restarts.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>I use go_router. Any particular reason you didn't use that?</summary><br>
  Actually, I have just been using auto_route for several projects and it has been working for me so I stick to it because I already familiar with it. No need to jump the band wagon and do what most or everyone is doing because every day there is an alternative to a package.
