title: The Motivation
---

 It is created to streamline and enhance the Flutter development process by providing a powerful yet easy-to-use CLI. In short, it enables you to quickly bootstrap **clear**, **readable**, **reusable**, **scalable**, **testable**, **performant**, **and maintainable** appsâ€”optimizing workflow, reducing setup time, boosting productivity, and maintaining consistency across different projects.

In more detail, this boilerplate aims to:

- **Provide developers with an efficient and enjoyable workspace** they look forward to using.
- **Enable the deployment of production-grade MVP products** by ensuring best practices and concepts are followed.
- **Minimize the learning curve and increase development speed** by offering a simple yet robust boilerplate, without compromising on quality.
- **Ensure easy horizontal scaling** as the application grows through a modular, decoupled architecture.
- **Save time and attention** by reducing boilerplate code, letting you write less and generate more.
- **Maintain code quality and platform standards** in team projects via strict linting rules.
- **Verify everything works as intended** by providing comprehensive unit and widget tests with 100% coverage from day one.
- **Ship applications quickly and efficiently** through CI/CD that automates key parts of the development process.
