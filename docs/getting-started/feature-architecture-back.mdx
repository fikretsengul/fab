# About The Feature Architecture

A typical Flutter app feature consists of various components, including widgets and state management solutions, models, handling HTTP requests, navigation routes etc. As Flutter apps grow in size, it's important to define an architecture that allows the app to scale, increases the app's robustness, and makes the app maintainable and scalable. Thats why we define the boundaries between parts of the app and the responsibilities each part "."should have.

We adopt a **layered architecture**, introducing a clear separation of concerns between different parts of the system. And this makes our code easier to read, maintain and test. A Flutter application feature should have at least three layers:

- The view layer (aka. presentation) that holds views which displays application data on the screen and states which manages and updates the widget state (that's the job of the BLoC).
- The model layer (aka. domain) that define application-specific model classes that represent the data that comes from the service layer.
- The service layer (aka. data) that contains the business logic of your app and exposes application data.

Each of these layers has its own responsibility, has unidirectional data flow between them and there's a clear contract for how communication happens across boundaries.

## About The Presentation Layer

CHATGPT EXPLAIN THE PRESENTATION LAYER (We call it as view layer)

> The role of the UI is to display the application data on the screen and also to serve as the primary point of user interaction. Whenever the data changes, either due to user interaction (like pressing a button) or external input (like a network response), the UI should update to reflect those changes. Effectively, the UI is a visual representation of the application state as retrieved from the data layer.

In our architecture, the views layer contains two main types of components:

1- **UI Elements**, which render the data on the screen such as Text, Image, Input or any Stateless/Stateful widget.
2- **State Holders**, such as (BLoC or Provider) that hold data, expose it to the UI elements, and handle UI events.

### The Service Pattern

As Flutter applications grow in complexity, managing data efficiently becomes crucial. The service (aka. repository) pattern — a strategic solution for effective data management. At its core, the service pattern is a design principle used to manage data flow between the application and data sources (like databases or network requests). It acts as a middle layer, a bridge if you will, between the business logic and data fetching mechanisms. This abstraction ensures that your business logic doesn’t need to know where or how data is stored or retrieved.

In our context, services found in the service layer (aka. data). And their job is to:

- Isolate **domain models (aka. entities)** from the implementation details of the service sources in the **services layer**,
- Convert **data transfer objects (eg. JSON objects)** to validated models that are understood by the **models layer**,
- (optionally) Perform operations such as **data caching**.

<Warning>Also note how the widgets belong to the views (aka. presentation) layer, which has nothing to do with business logic or networking code. Mixing the business logic with your UI code, make your code much harder to test, debug, and reason about.</Warning>

### When to use the Service Layer?

The repository pattern is very handy when the app is online and requires complex data layer with many different endpoints that return unstructured data (such as JSON) that you want to isolate from the rest of the app. Here are a few use cases where I feel the repository pattern is most appropriate:

- Talking to REST APIs,
- Talking to local or remote databases (e.g. Sembast, Hive, Firestore, etc.),
- Talking to device-specific APIs (e.g. permissions, camera, location, etc.).

### Advantages of the Service Layer

Introducing the service in Flutter brings numerous benefits:

- **Separation of Concerns:** It keeps the UI and logic separate from data source operations, resulting in a cleaner and more organized codebase.
- **Simplification of Data Handling:** With a centralized repository, data management becomes more straightforward and consistent.
- **Enhanced Testability:** Testing becomes easier as you can mock the repositories instead of real data sources.

<Success>The great benefit of this approach is that if there are breaking changes in any 3rd party APIs you use, you'll only have to update your service code.</Success>

In conclusion, we use the repository pattern to hide away all the implementation details (e.g. JSON serialization) of the service layer. As a result, the rest of the app (models (aka. domain) and views (aka. presentation) layer) can deal directly with type-safe model classes/entities. And the codebase will also become more resilient to breaking changes in packages we depend on.

MVC, MVP, MVVM, and Clean Architecture are some popular architectures that were introduced long ago to solve similar problems to the ones we face today with Flutter.

> Strictly speaking, MVC, MVP, and MVVM are design patterns, while clean architecture defines a set of rules and principles to help you architect any complex software system.

While the principles they were built upon are still very relevant today, they were not tailored for Flutter app development. Still, many attempts have been made to bring them to the Flutter world, with varying degrees of success.
